Liboobs 2.29.3, 2010-01-25
-----------------------------------------------
Liboobs version 2.29.3 "Tune Up" has been released.

- New function oobs_object_authenticate() allowing clients to request PolicyKit authentication to be more user-friendly
- Basic GError reporting support, used in the above function for now
- Fix OobsSelfConfig getting the UID of current user, and add oobs_self_config_is_user_self()
- Move from utmp to utmpx (thanks to Ed Schouten)


Liboobs 2.29.2.1, 2010-01-12
-----------------------------------------------
Liboobs version 2.29.2.1 "I Got It Bad And That Ain't Good" has been released.

- Fix missing header that was preventing the GNOME System Tools from building (GÃ¶tz Waschk)


Liboobs 2.29.2, 2010-01-11
-----------------------------------------------

Liboobs version 2.29.2 "Follow Suit" has been released. This release depends on the System Tools Backends 2.9.0.

- Move to the new System Tools Backends users and groups protocol. This mainly implies that OobsUser and OobsGroup are now OobsObjects, and can be committed individually, with new add() and delete() methods.
- Add new fields from this protocol: passwords are now in clear text, UIDs and GIDs can be guint32, new password and home flags, encrypted home boolean, locale and location.
- When committed, OobsUser is immediately updated with the D-Bus reply, to fill fields that were left empty and chosen by the platform tools.
- Add a lot of convenience functions to manage users and groups lists, taken from the GNOME System Tools.
- Raise OOBS_MAX_[UG]ID to G_MAXUINT32 on platforms where it is possible, now that the protocol supports it. Use << instead of pow().
- Fix OobsSession not being a singleton.

Liboobs 2.29.1, 2009-11-30
-----------------------------------------------

Liboobs version 2.29.1 "Not Yet!" has been released.

- Remember init scripts priority, allowing for GUIs not to care about them, simply passing 0 to mean "previous".
- Don't allow clients to remove init scripts by setting their status to "ignore": scripts should always use "start" or "stop" statuses, so that their priority is not lost when disabling them.
- Print a warning to the console when asynchronous commit fails. This ensures that errors will always be reported for debugging purposes.


Liboobs 2.22.2, 2009-09-06
-----------------------------------------------

Liboobs version 2.22.2 "Where's Waldo?" has been released.

Liboobs is a lightweight library that provides a GObject based interface to system-tools-backends. It's completely abstracted of the communication and authentication details, making it easy for applications to integrate with the system details.

Changes since last release
==========================

- Print error from D-Bus in case of failure on start. This should greatly help debugging.
- Don't consider empty user password as invalid.
- Make gtk-doc code documentation use inlined section comments, so that it is updated on every change. This will ensure the documentation does not get outdated again.
